# Scraping the OCP data

This notebook describes how I scraped ocpdb.pythonanywhere.com.

The Open Cannabis Project (OCP) closed as of May 31, 2019 and ocpdb.pythonanywhere.com is where their data is stored. This data is to be used as evidence of prior art and defensive documentation; one of the OCP's main goals.
